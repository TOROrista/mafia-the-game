Easy! Well, obviously, you have already read the README by now (you should! :anger: :laughing:)

comment at the [general discussion](https://github.com/TOROrista/mafia-the-game/issues/3) and share your concerns, we will try our best to respond to you as
soon as possible.

`For the assets`:
- Illustrator will be the main asset maker/editor
- The size of each artboard will be 500px by 500px
- For the rectangular grid tool, please refer to the settings below:
